# Medical-Insurance-Forecasting
Many people were denied access to the proper medication because they lacked insurance, which contributed to the unforeseen economic disaster that the epidemic has brought upon us all and the unprepared condition of unknown. This machine learning (ML) predicting model aids in knowing it well in advance so that users can make appropriate plans and set aside money for a significant rainy day. Finding the right algorithm for it was the challenging part. We were able to identify a workable algorithm and put this model into practise after conducting extensive research and working as a team. We hope that by doing this, the user will understand the value of health insurance and begin saving.
